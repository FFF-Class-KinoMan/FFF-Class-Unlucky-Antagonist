>Chaotia:
Fully encapsulated in the northern hemisphere, it's divided into three main subcontinents: Eastern Chaotia, Western Chaotia, and Euralia.

Eastern Chaotia:
Fully controlled by the Holy Rolandish Empire and divided into three main regions: Cisarpine Chaotia, Transarpine Choatia, and the Great Dune.

Western Choatia: 
Fully controlled by the CCCP except for the island of Mandrakia.

Euralia:
Technically not part of Chaotia, yet historically assigned to it. Fully controlled by the Bloodmane's Admiralty.




>Lawfullia:
Half inside the northern hemisphere, half inside the southern one, and the little isthmus that connects the two is on the equatorial line. It's divided into three main subcontinents: Joseon, Yamatai, and Tartaria.

Joseon:
Include all the lands above the equator except the steppe. Fully controlled by the Hakka Dynasty.

Yamatai:
Include all the lands beneath the equator except the steppe. Fully controlled by the Hakka-Bloodmane Dynasty except for the southern jungles, which are divided into countless Native tribes.

Tartaria: 
Include all the steppes in both hemispheres. Divided into hundreds of independent khanates, yet most of them are under the influence of the CCCP.




>Naturia:
Fully encapsulated in the southern hemisphere, it's divided into three main subcontinents: Karma, Enoch, and Anarchistan.

Karma:
Includes the 37 valleys, the Pacific Archipelago, and the Shangri-La Mountains. Except for the Thetacracy, it's too divided to define borders.

Enoch:
Includes the Everlasting Desert, the Ra's Valley, and the Hittite's plateau.  A third of it is colonized by Bloodmane's Admiralty, a third is controlled by the Hivemind, and the rest is divided into petty kingdoms.

Anarchistan:
Includes all the southern jungles. The environment and climate are too hostile to develop social structures more advanced than tribes.
