Welcome to the world of FFF-Class Unlocky Antagonist, a fantasy book by Kino-Man.

>Plot:

The origins of Jacques Dreux, the main antagonist of this universe, are narrated through his point-of-view. Starting from his years inside the most prestigious school of the Holy Rolandish Empire: the Miraval Academy.

>Genre:

It's a mix of my favorite ones: Fantasy Worldbuilding, Korean webtoon/novel litRPG, and Mystery.

1) Fantasy Worldbuilding: Dive in a full-fledged world that includes three continents populated by hundreds of nations with their own culture, language, and history.

2) LitRPG: Magic exists and its the source of all fundamental forces. However, people have created a system to manage it as in a videogame called 'Status Window' that includes: Skill-Tree, Inventory, Emails, etc...

3) Mystery: There is an official worldbuilding and a real one. The official is what the characters in the story believe: the mainstream narrative. To discover the real one, you'll have to dig by using as a shovel the hints each new chapter provides you, but be very wary because only a fool trusts anything he reads.

Since the main stage of the story is a school, some Teen-Drama is going to be present, but it's secondary to the main events.
